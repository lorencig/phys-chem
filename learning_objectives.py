    Upon completing this module, students will be able to:
    
    1. **Understand Adsorption Fundamentals:**  
       Describe the principles governing adsorption phenomena, including monolayer and multilayer adsorption.
    
    2. **Analyze Thermodynamics & Kinetics:**  
       Evaluate the roles of enthalpy (ΔH), entropy (ΔS), and equilibrium constants in adsorption processes.
    
    3. **Interpret Isotherm Models:**  
       Compare models such as Langmuir, BET, Freundlich, and Temkin.
    
    4. **Select Appropriate Models:**  
       Use system conditions and material properties to recommend a suitable adsorption model.
    
    5. **Apply Sensitivity Analysis:**  
       Investigate how changes in key parameters affect adsorption predictions.
